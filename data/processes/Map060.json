  "When do blacksmiths usually get up?": "",
  "Am I here too early? I should have asked someone.": "",
  "I hear something.": "",
  "Wow!": "",
  "She’s forging something... while naked.": "",
  "I can see her boobs... and her abs...": "",
  "*Gulps*": "",
  "She’s more athletic looking than the girls at school.": "",
  "I wish I can get closer...": "",
  "And I think I felt something twitching...": "",
  "??? <br>": "",
  "Hey!!!": "",
  "Oh crap!": "",
  "What are you doing here?": "",
  "Sorry, I heard a sound and I wanted to see what it was.": "",
  "I hope she believes me.": "",

  "It’s OK. I’m not angry.": "",
  "Wait a minute...": "",
  "This boy is staring way too hard...": "",
  "Anyway, I should be coming to you.": "",
  "You shouldn’t be coming to me.": "",
  "Huh?": "",
  "I don’t understand.": "",
  "You have to ring the bell.": "",
  "Bell?": "",
  "At the front. There should be a sign.": "",
  "I don’t think there is such a thing.": "",
  "I’m pretty sure there is.": "",
  "After all, I made it myself!": "",
  "Hmm. She doesn’t seem upset at me spying.": "",
  "OK. I’ll check.": "",
  "She’s right.": "",
  "Under the sign, the board states: \"Ring the bell before coming in\"": "",
  "Come in!": "",

  "You’re new around here, right?": "",
  "Yes, I am.": "",
  "I moved back here. I’m living with my auntie and her daughter.": "",
  "I want to grow up and be a farmer, and help my family.": "",
  "Ah...": "",
  "He’s so sweet and innocent.": "",
  "So is there anything you were looking for?": "",
  "Actually...": "",
  "I had a question...": "",
  "Um... may I ask why you were naked earlier?": "",
  "He’s staring again.": "",
  "Better try and ease his worries.": "",
  "It gets hot smithing.": "",
  "Plus, the clothes is too restrictive.": "",
  "So I like to work without one. Feels more natural.": "",
  "Isn’t that dangerous?": "",
  "Dangerous!?": "",
  "I'm the dangerous. It must be afraid of me.": "",
  "Ha-ha! You're so funny!": "",
  "How come you put an apron on then?": "",
  "That's a different story. Because you're here.": "",
  "I'm not that open to let everyone see me naked.": "",
  "That’s why I made the bell.": "",
  "So I’m not naked when someone come in.": "",
  "Everyone rings the bell before coming here.": "",
  "For the first time, you are the only one going straight inside.": "",
  "He-he! Sorry...": "",
  "Wow! That’s a real sword?": "",
  "Swords, spears, armor, and bolts...": "",
  "I thought those were just decorations.": "",
  "No. They seem to like it.": "",
  "But believe it or not, we attract a lot of business.": "",
  "This area is agricultural, not a town for hunting.": "",

  "Yeah.": "",
  "When you finish, maybe you’ll become an adventurer, who knows?": "",
  "I think you’d make a better one than me.": "",
  "I saw your muscles. You have a huge powerful frame.": "",
  "Your shoulders are really built.": "",
  "And your stomach. Your ab muscles are so taut and tight.": "",
  "I guess you must be on some sort of steroids, right?": "",
  "Ha-ha!": "",
  "You don’t have to use steroids to accumulate muscle mass.": "",
  "I don’t think that stuff is available out here.": "",
  "After all, steroids are for city people.": "",
  "I don’t think I’ve seen a woman that looks like you.": "",
  "I’m going to assume you’re not insulting me.": "",
  "N-no, of course not. I work out too.": "",
  "Your body is way bigger and stronger than mine though.": "",
  "Not to mention how sexy she is...": "",
  "I want to lick her abs...": "",
  "Thank you.": "",
  "Being a blacksmith doesn’t hurt.": "",
  "And I do like working out.": "",
  "Having abs comes mostly from diet though.": "",
  "Plenty of good food to eat around here.": "",
  "I should have figured.": "",
  "You’re way too beautiful to be on steroids.": "",
  "Oh, stop it!": "",
  "I’m serious!": "",
  "If you were on steroids, you’d look and sound masculine.": "",
  "But your muscles are perfect, and you look very feminine.": "",
  "And more importantly, your face is really cute.": "",
  "Cute?": "",
