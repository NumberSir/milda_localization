Me <br>
Good morning, \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0]! You sure an early bird!
\C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0] <br>
It's my job. I need to observe every detail to ensure the peace of this school.
(Ye, you sure did your job! You didn't do anything the first time I went to this school and got into trouble.)
What's going on? I can sense bad thoughts through your smile.
You're just overthinking. Anyway, have a good day!
You too! 
The class already ended one hour ago. What are you still doing here?
Sorry, \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0]! I'm too tired and overslept.
Seriously! You such a night owl. You should sleep earlier to ensure your health.
Enough talk. I will take you out.
Thanks, \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0]!
It's pitch dark in this place! Must careful not to make any loud noise.
\C[22]Theo\C[0] said, there is a ladder on the left.
I should start there to able to get into the school.
It's so dark! I'm starting to nervous!
Talk
Leave
Hey, it's nice to meet you.
Letting you know that your underwear is wide open. Everyone will see everything...
???
...
??? <br>
Oh! I know you!
What? Am I famous?
You're the pervert that walks around the school with his penis hanging out.
!!!
That is a misunderstanding. My pants got pulled down, I didn't know!
Besides, it would be better that you should introduce yourself.
I don't care. Stay away from me, pervert.
(What is wrong with her? I just wanna be nice.)
It's you again. What do you want now?
Tell her
I just want to say that your underwear is visible, everyone can see it.
Pff... Everyone? <br>
Do you mean? <br>
You.
Besides, I am wearing my pantie. You can't see anything except a piece of cloth.
But...
Won't you feel ashamed if you wore pants? No one could see your penis.
Maybe you're right. But, I feel something wrong. 
Wrong!?
You're such an idiot! Enjoy looking long as you want. It's a piece of cloth.
(Who is the idiot right now? I don't know...)
It's nothing. I'm just passing by.
Hmm... I just notice that you have been here for a while.
(This idiot again.)
(Hmm...)
(I guess teasing him a little bit won't hurt.)
(I bet he hungers to see my smoothie.)
Hmm... What is she doing?
Ha-ha! I guess you really want to see what it looks like under my pantie, right?
Sadly, you can't see anything.
(W-What? I didn't expect this to happen.)
(Wow!)
(It so beautiful. Smooth and pink.)
Eek!!?
What is in your pants? It got so big now.
Ha-ha! You even got a boner. Such a weirdo!
(Man, this is so embarrassing. But I guess I already got some benefits to fill that.)
(It's him again. Let's make the same recipe.)
(He wants to see my pussy so badly.)
Again
What just happened? I can't see anything.
You probably saw nothing.
Maybe later.
I'm not that idiot. Definitely.
That would be enough. It would be fucked up if she notice.
\C[2]Anna\C[0] <br>
Hurry up! You're too slow!
It's not that I'm slow but you're running too fast.
Haha! You are so weak!
I remember running up the mountain without taking a breath. What happened to my body since I got to the city?
Hey, \C[2]Anna\C[0]!
\n[1], this is \C[4]Lily\C[0]. She is my best friend!
Hi, \C[4]Lily\C[0]. Nice to meet you.
\C[4]Lily\C[0] <br>
Hello~
Well then \C[2]Anna\C[0], I'll just wait for you in the classroom.
See you around, \n[1].
Bye, \C[4]Lily\C[0].
Sorry, I have to go.
My teacher usually needs my help around this time.
It's okay. You should hurry and help her out then.
I'll see you after school then!
See you later.
Now! let's see what my new school looks like.
HEY! STOP RIGHT THERE, TWERP.
What are you doing here, brat? Separated from your mommy?
....No? I'm a transfer student, this is my first day of school.
You must have come to the wrong place, because this isn't a kindergarten.
Hey! Don't judge people by their looks. Just so you know, I'm over 18 years old.
And I'm pretty sure this is the school I'm gonna be studying at from now on.
If you're old enough to be here. You didn't come to the wrong place. I guess you already know my name by now.
Erm... No, I don't. Am I supposed to?
WHAT!!! You move here and you don't know my name??
That really hurt my soul. Now, give me money to heal my wounded soul.
WHAT!? That doesn't make any sense at all.
Then you better give me some money too. As my soul kinda hurts too now.
(Fuck! This always works on twerps. This brat is tougher than he looks. He didn't even get scared by my intimidation.)
(I can't beat him up right now, too many people around.)
(Maybe I should give him a swirly?)
(No wait, there's not a toilet outside...)
(Oh wait, I got an idea!)
Ayy! Look! There's a girl with no pantie on sitting over there!
(I'm a genius! This will definitely work on this idiot.)
(Now is my chance, I must hurry before he notices.)
Wow!  <br>
There actually is a girl with no pantie on sitting over there.
I can clearly see everything.
Damn... She looks so smooth and soft...
Shit! I was staring her too hard. Another thing got hard too!
Me  <br>
I hope no one saw me staring at her with an erection.
Wait.... WTF! What happened to my pants??
What is going on out here?
\C[21]Brad\C[0]. It's you again. I should have known.
For the last time, this is not your home. Stop playing around.
\C[21]Brad\C[0] <br>
Tsk!
You better watch your back or I will beat your ass next time. Twerp!
Ehem! You should put your pants back on.
Oh! I almost forgot about it. Sorry!
???  <br>
You seem to have forgotten how to hide your embarrassing "thing" as well.
Well, you see it anyways. So, there is no need to hide it now.
Well, at least you're a funny guy, I kinda like it.
Let me guess, you're \n[1], the new transfer student. Am I right?
Yea.
\C[31]Marie\C[0] <br>
Well, I'm the school's student council president. You can call me \C[31]Marie\C[0].
Nice to meet you, \C[31]Marie\C[0].
Is there something on my face?
I-It's nothing. I have never seen someone with white hair before and you seem kinda cool too. Sorry for staring though..
Cool? That's not a good word to praise a girl with you know. But, I guess I will accept it.
You look really beautiful when you smile then too, I hope I'll see you smiling some more often.
I will not fall for that, Mr. Playboy. 
Well the class is about to start, I have to go now.
If you have any problems, you can ask me after class.
Good luck on your first day. Until next time.
\C[31]Marie\C[0]: \C[3]+10\C[0] <br>
\C[31]Marie\C[0]: \v[101]
Man, this is so embarrassing.
Fortunately no one at the moment.
It's \C[2]Anna\C[0] best friend, \C[4]Lily\C[0].
Good morning, \n[1]. 
Good morning, \C[4]Lily\C[0].
They are going for a chat. What should I do now?
Stay
Yawn
It's so early.
It's so empty here. I could barely see anyone.
They really are going deep into the conversation. I don't know how some people could talk so much.
Tease \C[2]Anna\C[0]
He-he. There is no one around here.
This is a payback for the time she slapped my dick while I was sleeping.
So round and fluffy... My favorite.
!!?
Heeyyyy! 
What are you doing?
What's wrong, \C[2]Anna\C[0]?
It's nothing. I just fixing her skirt. It's not in the right place.
End
I will get in first. See you guys later.
See you after school.
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \C[3]+2\C[0] <br>
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \v[23]
It's locked.
\C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0] is still here!
\C[27]Mabel\C[0] probably would sneak into the school tonight.
Adjust the Ladder 
Use the Ladder
Back
Hehehe.
I already did it. 
Huh? There's something stuck on the fence!
Come Closer
Stupid fence! Why am I so unlucky!
It speared through my pants and I can't get down!
(There's someone down there. Maybe I can ask him for help.)
(Wait! Isn't he my classmate?)
(What is his name again? ...If I remember correctly it was probably \n[1].)
(This is bad! I don't want him to see me like this and tell everyone in the class.)
Huh? ...You really look like someone I've met.
Have we ever met?
(That's right! It's too dark now. I can keep my distance and change my voice so he can't recognize me.)
I'm this school student anyway. Perhaps you've seen me a few times.
Don't you mind give me a helping hand?
I've been hanging up here for quite a while. So now I feel really uncomfortable and dizzy.
I got lost in my thoughts and I forgot you were hanging on it.
Let me help you down.
(Well, well, well. What do we have here?)
(I still remember the last time she did to me.)
(It's time to take revenge.)
(What should I do with this unlucky person!)
\C[27]Mabel\C[0] <br>
Again! Are you kidding me?
It's him again!
(I can ask him to save me ... Damn! Almost forgot the last time.)
(Really sure, this time he won't help me again after all I've done to him.)
Hi! Sorry about last time!
Can you forgive me and help me down, please?
(Her pleading face looks so adorable!)
(If I have never seen about those things in \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0]'s office.)
(I will ignore the last time and help her without any hesitate.)
(But...)
(I've already seen your final form, \C[27]Mabel\C[0])
It's okay! I'll help you down right now!
(Such an idiot! It can only be as simple as this!)
Slap
Help
W-What are you doing!?
You're piece of shit! What the fuck are you doing?
That's it! I'm calling the police! You are done for!
I'm sorry! Please stop!
Huh?
Man! This is so fun!
Are you okay?
(Crap! I overdo it! Hope she's okay.)
You're gonna pay for this!
\C[27]Mabel\C[0]: \C[3]+3\C[0] <br>
\C[27]Mabel\C[0]: \v[103]
Hmm... What is this sticky liquid?...
\C[27]Mabel\C[0]: \C[3]+2\C[0] <br>
Hey! At Least Say, "Thank You!" before leaving!
Meh! I guess it just a piece of clothes.
I'm too tired. Better go home and take a good sleep.
Couple <br>
*Shoo* *Shoo*
Can't you see we are working, kid?
Thanks for your helping!
I'm glad to help you!
Anyway, why are you hanging up there?
Uhm... I saw a cute cat in school... and I wanted to go in there and pet it...
(I made a loud noise as I fell. \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0] will appear any moment, I must get out of here.)
Hey! Are you even listening?
I'm \n[1]. What is your name? Why are you so far away from me?
(This guy is so annoying! No time wasting, I have to get out of here!)
(It's \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0]!!!)
(I'm too slow! I can't out run her!)
(Exactly! I can use this idiot to buy some time for me.)
Hey! What are you looking at? Run!
Ouch! It hurts!
My face feels like burning and flatten. 
What is wrong with her? Why would she do this?
Hey!
Did you try to break into the school and steal something?
Wait! What!? Why would I do that?
So, can you explain these noises just now?
That's the sound when I fell to the ground...
You got busted and run. You were so clumsy that you fell on the ground.
Then, can you explain the previous sound? Like the metal noise, when someone like you tries to climb on those metal fences.
There was a girl trapped on that fence. I just helped her get down.
Are you out of your damn mind?
Now you're tellin' me your imagination nonexistent story?
Follow me! I need you to write something.
This place is bright enough. I need you to write something on here...
Wait! Ain't you the new transfer student?
It's me. I'm moving in here not so long ago.
I just wanted to go for a walk and fell into this bad situation.
It makes sense now. Sorry for yelling at you earlier.
It's okay! You're just doing your job.
You can go now! But don't get excited too soon! You are still on my list.
If I catch you making another suspicious noise again. You're in big trouble! Understand?
I understand. Thanks, \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0]!
*sigh*
What is this unlucky day? Better check the calendar before step out of the house next time.
Is he the one that \C[22]Theo\C[0]'s talking about?
I'm just a little zombie chasing a dummy man.
What... the fuck?
I'm faded...
What the hell? Are you on drugs or something!?
Damn, this is so embarrassing. Is he the dealer?
What is the last one? Kimchi war?
Kimochi waruiii...?
Aeyyyyyyy.
\c[16]Tuuku\c[0] <br>
Nice to meet you, bro! My name is \c[16]Tuuku\c[0].
Phew, it's him.
Here is your stuff.
\c[14]Massage Oil\c[0]\i[214] and \c[14]Massage Book\c[0]\i[230] \c[1]Acquired\c[0]
Thanks, man! Come back anytime.
Thanks!
Phew, I got it. Why is this stuff so hard to get?
Doesn’t matter. Next opportunity, I’ll give Auntie a massage.
I need \c[14]3000\c[0]\i[172]!
Hey! Do you need anything?
