Me <br>
Is that a banana tree? <br>
This is my first time seeing one.
Wow! This place looks like a cabin with a field over there...
...And chickens.
??? <br>
You came back a little earlier than usual, \C[5]Maleena\c[0].
So her name is \C[5]Maleena\c[0].
Who is this little one? Is he your new friend?
\C[5]Maleena\c[0] <br>
I was jumping off a tree and... <br>
landed my foot... on his face...
I brought him here because I was worried that he would get any injuries.
Can you check on him for me?
That's terrible.
Hmm... <br>
Everything... look fine. <br>
Except...
There are a few small scratches on the face.
This is my homemade medicine with natural herbs. <br>
It will heal scratches on your face.
How did you do that, kid?
Well, I don't know.
I felt a sudden gust of wind slap my face and my body immediately pulled back on its own.
That's incredible!
If you master it, you will be as slippery as a fish.
No one can land a punch on you.
Hmm...
Why are you touching my arms and legs?
Your physicality amazes me. <br>
Did you train something before?
I'm just doing some exercise and stretching.
\C[20]Ek\c[0] <br>
My name is \C[20]Ek\c[0]. <br>
She is my granddaughter, \C[5]Maleena\c[0].
I'm \n[1]! Nice to meet you!
You are a bit old to learn martial arts but you have many things that can make you a great fighter.
How about this?
I can teach you, Muay Thai. My homeland fighting style.
Do you want to be my student?
No.
Hahaha!
Good! <br>
We can start tomorrow!
NO!? <br>
What!? Why?
It's boring and takes a lot of time!
Well yes, it is! <br>
But you can fight bad buddies and many girls will fall in love with you.
I will teach you for free.
We are not in an action movie. <br>
Bad guys aren't everywhere.
And I have more important things to do.
That's too bad...
Okay, you just missed your chance.
It will be kinda pricey if you want to learn something from me.
\C[5]Maleena\c[0], walk your little fella out.
What is with him?
He turns his face like flipping paper.
What are you doing, Grandpa?
Don't call me like that!
I'm feeding the chickens.
It looks interesting. <br>
Do you need my assistance?
What!? <br>
I thought you didn't want to do boring things.
You won't get anything from this old man.
They call me the helper boy.
More importantly, <br>
I wouldn't do this every day, tho. <br>
I do what I want.
Alright. <br>
Little force is better than nothing.
But I won't give you anything for your help.
What should I do now?
Feeding is enough.
Okay, leave it to me.
*Phew*
Done!
How is that?
Haha! <br>
Thanks for your help, little one.
\C[20]Ek\c[0]: \C[3]+5\C[0] <br>
\C[20]Ek\c[0]: \v[145]
What are you doing here?
Shop
Help
No
Heh heh! <br>
It's always welcome if you buy woods and stones from me.
Let me help you feed the chickens!
Ha ha! <br>
Thanks!
Thank you for your help but it kinda ruined my hobby.
Haha!
Watch
Can I sit here and watch your training?
Just don't touch anything. <br>
You are not my student anyway.
Especially that punching bag.
Damned! <br>
I shouldn't have refused so quickly.
The training session is over.
I don't think you're still sitting here.
Thank you for letting me observe. <br>
It's really interesting.
\C[5]Maleena\c[0]: \C[3]+3\C[0] <br>
\C[5]Maleena\c[0]: \v[165]
I'm about to start my morning training.
You can stay here and watch, <br>
It's pretty interesting!
Holy shit! <br>
I can't even see his hand.
How can you do that?
Gahaha!
This is nothing compared to when I was younger.
I can chop all these logs in one minute.
I somehow believe in it...
Does material arts training make people that strong? 
Now I regret that decision...
Why are you here for?
You said I come here for the Bee House solutions.
Oohh! <br>
I almost forgot.
We will talk about it later after I've finished all of this.
All right! <br>
Morning warm up done!
Damn...
Here!
What is this!?
A Workbench! <br>
The most important thing if you want to build anything.
Go to the desired location and place it.
It's just... a scroll!??
What did you just say?
Oh, SNAP!!! <br>
Fantasy, MAGIC! <br>
I forgot!
What? I'm still listening.
Okay!?
So after placing the Workbench. <br>
How can I make a Bee House "Scroll"?
Workbench is a finished product.
Before that you need a Blueprint. <br>
You can buy it from me, here.
After gathering all the necessary Materials listed in the Blueprint, you can go to your Workbench and use all of those to create a final product.
The basic materials are Wood, Stone and Nails.
I have to go to the forest to chop trees now?
No, no, no! <br>
You can only do that if you have a logging license. 
There're \c[1]Tree Stumps\c[0] around the forest, <br>
you can get wood from cutting those.
Not every stone will work. <br>
Only choose the \c[1]Bluish Stones\c[0], they contains some iron elements which will make the structure more solid.
Heh heh heh...
Or...
You can buy those from me as well but it has a really high price.
How much is it?
\c[17]100\c[0]\i[172] each.
You gotta be kidding me.
I could build a solid gold house with those materials money.
He he!
Then the only way you can go now is to find them by yourself.
By the way, <br>
I'm the only one selling wood and stone in this town.
Dang!
It will be more fun by doing it yourself, little one.
Oh! I still have something for you.
An axe from my great, great grandfather.
It's in a bad condition and I can't use it anymore.
Better give it to someone than throw it away.
Wow, Thanks!
There's only one blacksmith in town. <br>
It can be fixed there.
\C[2]Danesia\c[0]?
Oh, you knew her?
I have some business with her before.
You can buy \c[1]Nails\c[0] and \c[1]Hammer\c[0] from her too.
\c[17]100\c[0]\i[172] for each Nail?
Gahaha! <br>
It ain't that much!
That should be everything.
Did you catch up?
I got it all.
Thank you, Grandpa!
No problem!
So, it should be.
Buy a \c[1]Blueprint\c[0] from Grandpa \C[20]Ek\c[0], <br>
collect all the \c[1]Necessary Materials\c[0] listed in the blueprint then go to the \c[1]Workingbench\c[0]...
And Voila!
Choose the \c[1]Desired Location\c[0] and place the \c[1]Final Product\c[0].
I can get \c[1]Wood\c[0] and \c[1]Stone\c[0] from chopping \c[1]Tree Stumps\c[0] and mashing \c[1]Bluish Rocks\c[0].
But first I need to place the \c[1]Workbench\c[0] first.
There's a small area near my Planting Spot. <br>
I should place it there.
\c[14]Workbench\c[0]\i[191] and \c[14]Broken Axe\c[0]\i[255] \c[1]Acquired\c[0]
You've learned how to build a \c[14]Bee House
\c[1]New Honey Quest has been added <br>
