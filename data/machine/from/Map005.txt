Shouldn't bother while she's sleeping.
That should be enough.
The doorâ€™s locked.
How am I supposed to get in there?
Hmm...
I need a key, but where could I get one? I need to think about this some more.
Better hurry to my magic hole!
Better not.

Hey \n[1], I had a dream last night. I was milking a cow and her milk sprayed all over my face.
When I woke up, my face was still sticky for some reason, just like in the dream. Weird, right?
... I guess it must have been your saliva.
Ohhh... Maybe you're right, that does make sense.
Yay! It's \c[2]Christmas\c[0]!
Are you ready, \n[1]? We can go to school together after I finished brushing my teeth..
Sure!
I have something to do
Yay!
Ehh...! Why not? It would be more fun.
We're not kids anymore.
What's your plan today, \n[1]? Do you wanna play with me?
Maybe later when I have some spare time.
I must hurry!
