I'm too tired.
Looking good today.
She has already been milking.
\C[2]Anna\C[0] <br>
It's time for the cows to go out the barn.
Better keep them refresing so we can have more milk.
Don't you think those cows are cute! 
Help
Let's Play
How to Milk?
Work faster if there is a helping hand. Thank you very much, \n[1]!
Let me help you with those cows.
Wow! Thank you so much. 
*You have received "\c[1]Milk the Cows\c[0]" quest*
*You can quickly view the Quest log by Press "\c[1]A\c[0]" key.*
*Double click on the Quest to track it. Which mean, it will appear each time you view the quest log.*
There are still more.
Here you go! I have finished milking all the cows.
Eh? Why is there so little milk?? Did you do it properly?
Hehe...
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \C[3]+2\C[0] <br>
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \v[23]
Thank you very much! You really helped me a lot.
Well, I just love being able to help you out.
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \C[3]+3\C[0] <br>
Uhmmm~ <br>
Your ass is so delicious, \C[2]Anna\C[0]...
I really want to taste it for a long time.
What!? <br>
I haven't bathed since the morning! <br>
It's all sweaty and dirty.
I don't smell anything strange tho!?
Hahaha! <br>
You're such a weird jackass!!!
??? <br>
\n[1]!
M-Mom!?
\C[21]Joyce\C[0] <br>
Oh! My lovely baby! <br>
I miss you so much!
Come! Let mommy hug you!
AHhhhh~
Holy! <br>
They are goddamn huge!!
Mom! I can't breathe!!!
Oh!! <br>
Sorry, Honey! 
I'm just a little excited.
What did you do earlier?
I-I just wanted to help \C[2]Anna\C[0] tie her shoelaces.
As I expected for my son. <br>
He is truly a gentleman.
You help your mother as always?
Look at you! <br>
You've grown into such a fine lady!
Hi, Aunt \C[21]Joyce\C[0]!
Come here, a hug for you too!
Hi hi! <br>
Boobies!
Why are you coming back here all of sudden, Mom?
What about all the stuff in the city?
He he! <br>
Your beautiful and intelligent mother has been promoted!
I don't have to deal with all the work like before.
Whoa!
Wow! <br>
So cool!!
Because of that, <br>
I think it's the right time for a small trip back here.
And I was right! 
The air is so fresh and gentle breezes blow over my skin.
I could feel my skin alive again from the moisture in the air.
Ahhh~ <br>
It feels like centuries. So nostalgic...
Hehe! <br>
Same for me!
I will deal with you later for leaving your lovely mom alone!
!!?
I will go and meet my dear sister.
Aunt \C[21]Joyce\C[0]'s boobies are so big as always.
Damn! I don't remember that! <br>
Probably the Magic Illusion Dome...
Hehehe! <br>
Someone's butt is about to get smashed!
Shut up!
\C[21]Joyce\C[0]: \C[3]+10\C[0] <br>
\C[21]Joyce\C[0]: \v[27]
Thanks for your helping. All work has been completed. Let's play a game!
What game should we play? Say,\n[1]. Do you have any idea?
Hide and Seek

Change My Mind
My favorite game. Let's go!
Let's use Rock-Paper-Scissors. The loser will be Hider and the winner will be Seeker.
Okay! As usual.
(Really sure, she will choose Rock.)
(Really sure, she will choose Paper.)
(Really sure, she will choose Scissors.)
(Hmm... What will she choose?)
Rock
Paper
Scissors
Think Again
A draw. Let's do it again.
Yay! I win.
Okay! So unlucky.
Ha-ha! You are no match for me.
How can you be so good?
It's so fun. Let's play more sometime.
The rules remain the same, I'll hide around here. If you can't find me in 20 seconds you will lose.
Alright! Close your eyes. No peeking!
I'm ready!!!
Can even hear her calling?
Anyway, let's find her.
I'm coming!!!
Nevermind, I suddenly remembered that I still had some work to do.
Eh... Fine. Maybe later.
Sorry, \n[1]. I can't play with you right now. Still some works to do.
She kind of busy, maybe later.
Sorry, \n[1]. I can't play with you today.
Can you show me how to milk the cows again? 
Sure! 
Thank you, Anna. I'm feeling pretty great after that.
Anna <br>
???
Hey, Anna! Would you mind teaching me how to milk the cows?
I have seen you doing it lots now. And I must say, it looks really fun. Since I want to help around in the barn, it'll be perfect!
I thought I should learn how to do some of the different daily tasks.
You've came to the right place. To be honest, I am the best milker in town.
As the saying goes: "The good teacher makes the bad student good, and the good student excellent".
Sounds promising. So, can we start the class now? Ms. Anna?
Haha! Everyone take your seats. The class begins now.
(Maaan! She looks serious all of a sudden.)
Are you ready? 
I'm as ready as I can ever get, Ms. Anna.
I will show you how to milk a cow, my pupil. 
.
..
...
(She's skillful with her hands. The milk is coming out so easily.)
(I'm getting horny.)
Next
\n[1]! 
......Oh, what?
What are you thinking? You should focus.
And I can see you put another "stick" in your pants again.
......
Sorry, I spaced out. Can you show me again?
Sure, I will go slow this time.
You can start now. I will focus this time.
(I should focus this time. It'll be embarrassing if she sees my boner again.)
(It seems there's a rhythm to it. I'll be able to do it after seeing this.)
I think I get it now, can I give it a try?
By the way, are you sure this will be okay? I don't want to get hoof print on my face.
What do you mean? She's really nice, don't worry.
See?
Alright, it's your turn now.
WOW, you are a natural at this. You can already do it on your first try.
Hehe... This is too easy. I guess that might be why you're so good at it.
Hey! Don't get cocky now, \n[1]!
I'm sorry, but it was actually really fun doing this. So, maybe I can help you milk the cows from now on?
Yea, you're right. I also find it really fun doing this.
Her breasts are also soft and squeezy. It feels super good when I play with them.
..... (I'm sure those aren't the only soft breasts right here.)
Her milk is good too. It feels like I'm in heaven when I suck it out directly from her udder.
... (sucking the udders....)
Oops... Please don't tell my Mom, okay? She'll beat me up if she finds out I do that.
And don't worry. I won't tell her if you want to do the same as well.
This will be our little secret.
(Man, It was all normal until now.)
(There are some weird things I can't get out of my head now.)
(I guess it's okay since she's just a cow.)
(And the way Anna milked that cow. I wouldn't mind knowing how it would feel if she did that to me.)
Your face is kind of creepy at the moment, \n[1]...
Hehe.
\C[6]*You learned how to Milk*\C[0]
Ha-ha. You are so bad.
Ha-ha. You are so bad. I really enjoy seeing you wiggling your butt all around just to find me.
Ha-ha...
I will get you next time.
The sun had already set, let's go home and eat!
Thank you for helping me! It's really freaking me out at that moment.
It's fine! That's what you get for cheating.
Anyway, your butt is so damn big. I really enjoy the moment when you wiggle your butt to get out.
Ha-ha! Hey! That's hurt.
Auntie is waiting, let's go home and eat!
\C[2]Anna\C[0] <br> 
You letting out so much! It all over my skirt now!
It's so sticky and gooey.
*Sniff! Sniff!*
It smells like butter...
I wouldn't taste it if I were you. It is lubricant after all.
Oh! I forgot.
Anyway, thank you so much for helping out!
It feels weird but I really enjoy it.
Hey!!!
Stop dragging me!
Let’s go, let’s go.
Where are we going anyway?
To the clothing store, obviously!
You need some new clothes too.
Uh.. Maybe I’ll get something.
I think I’ll buy some clothes for \C[2]Anna\C[0].
She’s been really nice to me.
And \C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] too.
Thanks for going shopping with me today, \n[1]!
It's noon already! Did we spend that much time?
I'm starving! Let's go home and have lunch.
I should go back to the \c[1]Clothing Store\c[0] when I have enough money.
I need to buy two dresses and give them at dinner.
It's a well. I can fill up my \c[1]Watering Can\c[0] here!
It's a well. <br>
Back in the day, Anna and I used to bathe here.
I can fill up my \c[1]Watering Can\c[0] here!
There is no water left. Must refill the \c[1]Water Can\c[0].
\c[3]\v[281]\c[0]\I[224]Turnip Seeds 
\c[3]\v[282]\c[0]\I[225]Potato Seeds 
\c[3]\v[283]\c[0]\I[226]Cucumber Seeds 
\c[3]\v[284]\c[0]\I[227]Corn Seeds 
I'm too tired. Need to eat something or take a little rest to restore my stamina.
That was such a long journey. I just want a bath and food.
I moved back here to continue my studies.
It's a strange feeling being back after all this time.
The air is much cleaner and fresher than in the city. Everything feels nostalgic already, not much has changed.
It's good to finally be back.
It's Mom!
Hi, mom! I just arrived at Auntie's house.
It's still the same. The air is so fresh and clean.
\C[20]Mom\C[0] <br>
Aww. How nostalgic. I really want to go back there now. 
Didn't I tell you to come back here? 
But mommy has work to do. 
You left your beautiful mom here alone and went back with your lovely auntie.
How old are you? Don't act like a little girl.
Don't worry, mommy will come back once in a while.
It's time to work!
Take care, honey. Don't stay up too late. 
Here. In case you miss your mommy.
Huh? What is this?
*Phew*. No one here.
Anyway...
This is my \c[12]Phone\c[0]. \c[12]P\c[0] is the \c[2]Hotkey\c[0]. There is some useful stuff in there.
I put it in \c[12]Key Item\c[0] in case if I need it.
Hm... Now that I'm here, I wonder where is Aunt Daisy?
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] <br>
Oh dear! Is that you, \n[1]?
I thought you were coming in the evening.
If I had known you would've come this early, I would have picked you up at the harbour.
Don't worry Auntie, It's okay.
The trip was a lot faster than I expected. I arrived earlier than expected.
My phone is out of battery and I decided to go for a walk.
Oh! My poor little guy. I hope you weren't waiting too long outside for me. 
(This is Auntie \C[20]Daisy\C[0], my mom's sister)
(We used to live together in this house, back when I was a little kid.)
(By the way, you can PRESS H to hide the TEXT BOX.)
(Shit! I can't breath!)
Struggle
(Hmm. What is this? I grabbed something big and soft.)
(This... It feels AMAZING.)
Oh my! I'm really sorry. Are you okay, \n[1]?
I was so happy to see you again after such a long time, I couldn't hold back...
It's ok Auntie, I'm fine.
(What just happened? I remember that I grabbed something really big and soft.)
(Wait.. It was Auntie's Boob! And it's same size as my head!)
(It was so BIG and SOFT. My hand just sank right in it.)
(What is this? My heart is beating so fast, I'm starting to feel so hot now.)
\n[1]... \n[1]. Are you Okay? Your face is red.
W-What did you just say, Auntie?
Nevermind that, maybe you got tired after a long trip. Let's go inside, you need some rest.
Okay, Auntie.
(Auntie's boob felt so good. I wish I could squeeze it more.)
Hi, Auntie!
Can you teach me how to cultivate?
Are you interested in farming?
More importantly, should you spend more time studying? 
You don't have to worry too much. I only do this during my free time. 
Isn't cultivation also a job? I just want to have more experience in the future.
Ha-ha. Fine! Just want to let you know that this job is not that simple. It's very laborious and tiring. 
What are you saying! There is no work that I can't do.
But more importantly, isn't this work both profitable and healthy? 
All right then, if you insist.
There's a small plot of land below. I think it will work for you. 
Hooray!!!
Follow me!
Okay, here it is!
This land has been abandoned for a long time, so grasses are everywhere. 
The first step is to clean up the weeds.
*Phew!*
I got all wet just from cleaning them all! 
*Gulp*
Let's go to the next step... 
Take these!
Do you notice the bottom right corner? 
What are you talking about?
You can click on the arrow mark to show or collapse the tools icons. 
Select the tool you need to use it. You can click on the square in which the tool is currently selected to get more information about it.  
Are you catching up? 
Good!
T-Thanks! I guess.
I don't even understand what she said! Better to find out by myself.
Be careful when using the tool, it can destroy your crop. 
Here! 2 bags of \I[224]Turnip Seeds. It was leftover long ago but I think it's still usable. 
Do you remember \C[25]Douie\C[0]? 
\C[25]Aunt Douie\C[0]?
That's right! You can buy seeds from her. Her farm is on the right side next to us. 
Her seeds always the best quality, Seeds germinate 100% successfully. 
I don't know what it is but it's so cool! 
Alright then! I think that's all. If you have any problem you can ask me.
How can I sell the things that I've grown, Auntie?
Oops! My clumsiness. 
Ha-ha, I forgot the most important thing.  
At \c[20]4 PM\c[0], \C[3]Pixie\c[0] will arrive, you will find her standing in front of the cornfield. She buys almost everything, you can sell them to her.
Cool!
Good luck with your work! 
Thanks, Auntie!
\c[1]New Economy Quest has been added <br>
\c[21]You can access Quest Logs by 'A' key or through Menu
So exciting!
Now, I can grow crops to make money to buy the things that I need. 
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0]: \C[3]+3\C[0] <br>
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0]: \v[21]
What are you doing, Auntie?
Hmm, I haven't seen \C[20]Mae\C[0] since morning.
Huh?
What is wrong with that?
Oh! The thing is.
She always comes here to get milk every morning.
I think she had a funny stomach. He-he.
I have nothing to do at the moment. Would you like me to help you deliver it?
Thank you very much, Sweetie!
Count on me!
Here!
See you later!
I'm busy working with the cornfield. Do you need anything? 
You can go home now.
Workers <br>
Are you sure? There’s still some left.
Don’t worry about it. Go home and get some rest.
Thank you, ma’am!
Auntie?
Over here, \n[1].
What are you up to?
I’m harvesting the rest of the corn.
I want to do it before nightfall so I can take these to the market tomorrow.
Let me help with that!
No, it’s OK, I’m almost done.
It’s no bother. I want to help.
This will be the last one for today.
Phew... I'm beat!!!
Why is it so hot today? Will it rain?
Oh no!
We need to hurry!
Phew, the weather is so hot.
I should have brought a new change of clothes...
!!!
It’s just like before...
I can see her boobs through her shirt.
Her nipples are poking out, I wonder if she notices...
Thank you, \n[1]. You’re such a good boy.
Sweet!!
*Phew*
It was a lot of work. 
Thank you very much for helping me, \n[1]!
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0]: \C[3]+2\C[0] <br>
It's so hot! I'm all sweaty.
You already helped me today. Go get some rest, sweetie.
Auntie's cooking is amazing. It tasted so good, I almost bit my tongue while eating.
I'm all hyped up. It feels perfect for my first school day.
Well, better get going. I bet Anna's waiting for me outside.
I shouldn't let her wait for too long on my first day.
Hey, \n[1]. Over here!
Coming!
Sorry for the wait.
It's fine. I haven't been here that long.
Say \n[1], are you nervous? It's your first day of school after transfering and all.
Nah, I'm very excited. 
I'm ready to see new people and make new friends.
Hehe, you're right. It will be more fun around here as well, when you have more friends.
Just before we go, did remember to get everything you need?
Yea, I'm sure I got everything I needed.
Then, let's go.
\n[1], Anna. WAIT!!
(WOW! Auntie's boobs are bouncing like crazy.)
(They aren't making any sound, but somehow I hear them bouncing in my head.)
I'm glad that I made it in time.
Do you need something, mom?
Oh, nothing like that. 
I wanted to say good luck to \n[1], since it's the first day going to a new school..
So, \n[1], good luck!
And, remember. You don't have to be the best at everything in school, you just have to try your best.
Auntie... I'm not a kid anymore.
You haven't changed since ten years ago, sweetie. 
I still see you as my little boy.
Oh, before I forget. Here's 100\i[172]. Use them if you need to buy something.
Wow! Thanks Auntie.
You too Anna.
Yay! You're the best, mom!
Me too! Me too!
Stop playing with them! You're not a kid anymore.
Hehe. Your boobs are so big, soft.. It's felt good.
(Man... I wish I could play with them like that too...)
Bye, auntie. See you later.
Bye, Mom.
Good luck you two.
Let's go!
I should wait for the School to open on Monday.
School
Blacksmith
Shop
It's \c[10]Christmas\c[0]. Better go there tomorrow.
I should go there in the morning.
Convenience Store
Clothing Store
Thank you, Sweetie. 
Maybe I can help Auntie with the laundry next time?
Helpless ass looking for helping.
Hmm...
W-What is this!?
\C[2]Anna\C[0], is that you?
Bro! I'm stuck.
I'll get you out of it right now!
Better go in the Barn and help her out.
Pull Her Out
Or...
Back
Well! I guess I gotta do what I gotta do.
(Oh, boi! I can't even imagine, her butt is so damn big and fluffy.)
Me <br>(
(Instead of helping her to get out...)
(Or...)
(I guess I should play with it for a bit.)
Okay! I will help you get out now. It could take... for awhile.
Okay! Just hurry!
Too early.
Better go there in the morning.
Not now.
What are you doing?
Mom said the scarecrow was broken and she wanted me to help her fix it.
Do you need any help?
I'm fine.
She is so skillful, feel like she disappears.
I've seen you already, get out of there.
This is normally working, guess she gets smarter.
Okay! I give up. You can come out now.
Phew!
My back feels so hurt!! It was harder than I imagined.
Alright! Let's carry this bad boy back and decorate it in my room.
A good looking pine. Excellent material for \c[2]Christmas\c[0] tree.
I can borrow Auntie's Axe in the Barn to cut it down.
A Snowman!!!
How can she make it?
Not too shabby! Looking really good tho.
Hmm... It's not bad but something just ain't right.
It's the nose! Isn't it supposed to be a carrot?
Ha-ha! She used tomato instead of carrot!
Now it looks as dumb as its owner.
Ha-ha!
Auntie said \C[3]Pixie\c[0] was coming at this time of day.
I wonder... what does she look like?  
There's someone over there! It must be her. 
Wait a minute... She's floating... or maybe she's flying! 
She really looks like a fairytale fairy. 
Holy shit, I have to hurry up and take a closer look before she disappears! 
\C[3]Pixie\c[0] <br>
Oh, Hi! I'm \C[3]Pixie\c[0]. Do you have something you want to sell? 
H-Hi! My name is \n[1]. 
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]...
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]! Isn't that the person Auntie was talking about? 
Wait! If so, wasn't she here the whole time? Why haven't I seen her before? 
Hello! 
Oh, sorry! I was thinking about something else. 
Ha-ha. You're such a strange person. 
Ha-ha. It's just the first time I've seen a fairy. 
Anyway, are you a fairy?
Actually I'm a flower fairy.
Aren't fairies... I mean, flower fairies are tiny? Why do you look so big? Looks like the size of a human kid. 
Well, I made myself bigger. It is more convenient for my job.
Magic surely incredible...
The flower on your head is so strange. Do you plant it with your head?
Your way of speaking is so strange. It felt like I was being humiliated.
The flower on my head is part of me. Like legs and arms. 
It's so cool! Can I touch it? I've never seen a flower like this before? It makes me really curious. 
Sure! But just a little bit. It is very sensitive. 
Don't worry, don't worry. I just touched it lightly. 
She's so cute!
Okay! I'm running now!
Hm... 
This feeling...
It is soft and thick. It felt more like human flesh than a flower petal.
Are you done yet, isn't it just a little? 
Are these stamens?
It looks weird. It felt like I was squeezing a small meatball. 
Are you done yet? I feel very strange. 
It will be quick. Do not worry. I'm almost done. 
He-he.
Where is her Pistil anyway? Can't seem to find it.
Okay, let's see what's in this flower.
It is so deep. I can put my whole finger in it. 
Holy shit! Where is her brain at? 
My thought was not wrong, she used her head to raise this flower. Ha-ha.
What the hell is it! It's so warm and slippery. 
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
What are you doing? Didn't you say just a little? 
Didn't I say it's very sensitive? 
Chill! Relax!
How old are you? Why are you throwing sand at other people? 
Some of them flew into my eyes.
Huh? It wasn't sand!
It is fairy dust. Now you will shrink and will be punished by me.
... by now.
Any second... 
Why didn't it work?
Ha-ha! Look like someone's "powder" is useless.
Huh? What is this strange feeling? 
MY DICK!!!
Why is it this tiny!?
Ha-ha!!! It turned out to be effective. 
WHAT!? Please make it back!
Don't worry. It only affects for a short period of time. 
Your tail will return to normal. 
*Phew*. It was really scared me. 
Seeing your fearful look really pleased me. 
All right, I have to go, there are a lot of customers waiting for me. 
*Phew*. It was really scared the shit out of me.
Fortunately, it is only temporary. 
Is it this late already?
Better to go home for dinner. 
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]: \C[3]+10\C[0] <br>
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]: \v[33]
Hello! How are you? 
It's you, \n[1]! Do you have something you want to sell? 
What! Don't always say that. Let's talk. 
The truth is I have something to ask... 
Sure, go ahead! I'm also free at this time.  
Well...
About the powder you used earlier to throw at me. I wanted to buy some of it.
You mean \c[14]Tiny Miny Mini Dust\i[317]\c[0]?
Yes, that's it! I want to buy it for my... research. Do you sell it? 
Yes, It's one of the things that I can sell. But... it's very expensive... 
H-How much is it?
500\i[172] for a pinch.
Ha-ha, you kidding me, right? 500\i[172] for a bag, it's so cheap. 
WAIT WHAT!? 500\i[172] for a pinch. 
Why don't you rob? Wasn't that the last time you threw a bunch at me? 
Do you want to buy it or not?
... 
Fine! What a monopolist malice. 
Will it work? 
Of course it will work! 
Don't say I haven't told you before.
If you use it on someone else without their permission, I won't sell it to you next time. 
Don't worry, don't worry! I only use it on my di... I mean, for my research!
\c[1]*You can now buy \c[14]Tiny Miny Mini Dust\i[317]\c[1]from \c[3]Pixie\c[1].*
\c[1]*It's only used for special events. Other than that, it's useless.*
There are some questions that keep stuck in my head.
Why are those people around me so familiar with magical things? 
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0], \C[2]Anna\C[0]...
Why do they look so... hot? <br>
I don't remember having that feeling before I left here and went to the city with my Mom.
I feel like there's something wrong with my memories...
I don't want to ask them, it will bring many troubles...
Maybe \C[3]Pixie\c[0] is a good choice.
She seems careless. <br>
I guess I can crack some information from her.
I bought a Lolipop for \C[2]Anna\C[0] on my way back here...
But... I guess it has a better use. 
Hehehe...
Just be careful and it should be okay. <br>
She looks stupid.
Hi there, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
How is your work?
It's getting warmer lately so I feel a bit tired flying around.
Luckily, I have a special potion that can keep me cool.
Magic...
Do you have anything to sell me today?
Haha! 
I'm still digging in my field. <br>
They will soon be harvested in no time.
That's great!
I have something for you. <br>
It's a lollipop, I hope you like it. 
Wow, Thanks!
Did you put something in here?
Something like sleeping powder. <br>
You will sell me to the merchant after I pass out.
What!!? I am not that kind of person!
Just a small thanks for helping us.
Hihihi! <br>
Just kidding!  
Anyway, How did you meet my Auntie?
I guess she was a bit "surprised" the first time she saw you.
I just went over and asked her if she wanted to sell me something.
What is so surprising about that?
Yeah, it feels like a fork and chopsticks.
So normal <br>
Just like we were born in a fantasy world in the first place.
No! <br>
There is no such thing like this!
At the time I was in the city, <br>
I haven't spotted a magic thing or someone talked about it...
But there is a fairy flying around and everyone waving at her in my hometown.
Your cuteness and petiteness!
Thanks!
You come here, buy things and bring them back to your world, right?
I really want to go there for a long time. <br>
Can you be my tour guide?
Your world gotta be amazingly beautiful!
You must be kidding me! <br>
Only your ashes can reach our world.
Wait! <br>
What do you mean?
Oh! You didn't know about it?
Only we can go to your world - the Earth.
You can't come to our world because of the barrier.
Everyone knows that.
Haha! <br>
Look at my memory, I forgot about that. 
Wait!
Hmm... <br>
You look sus!
I knew it from the first time we met!
Damned! <br>
She's smarter than she looks!!! 
Where did I go wrong?
Chill! <br>
It's normal for someone to forget something.
I know there is an alchemist witch not far from here. <br>
She's addicted to flesh-and-blood experiments.
You can be sold for a good price.
Hahaha!!!
Aren't we friends?
You can't do that to me!!!
Just kidding! No way I would do that.
Hahaha!
I was just acting too! <br>
You look tired so I just want to cheer you up.
You're \C[20]Daisy\C[0]'s nephew. <br>
I know her very well.
Even if there's something wrong with you.
With your frail body, <br>
you can't do anything harmful to our world. 
You will regret saying this.
To be clear. <br>
I lived here before, <br>
I went with my Mom to the city because of her work.
I didn't like the atmosphere of the city so I came back here again.
I could feel there's something wrong with me.  <br>
I didn't know you guys existed like everyone else.
I feel like I'm the only one awake in this world... <br>
and some of my memories are somehow sealed and only open themselves again at some point!
Interesting! 
I met everyone on this island and no one share the same thing.
You may telling lie or you're special.
I will take that as a compliment.
I don't know much about this but I will tell you what I already know.
People from our world discovered the portal to your world not so long ago.
We still haven't known when was it there and who made it.
After a lot of investigation, <br>
it was pointless to keep digging deep into that so we gave up.
What!? That's so careless. <br>
What if someone takes our weapons that can nuke your world? 
In case you don't know what a nuke is, <br>
it easily blows up the whole town in the air.
We already knew that and have done many tests. <br>
Anything that leads to war or threats always comes priority on our list.
The pew-pew, zap-zap related things,... <br>
as soon as they go to the portal, they strangely... <br>
don't work anymore. 
Magic items strongly weaken when they arrive in your world.
We still don't know why, <br>
maybe each world has its own system.
In my world, I can beat ten of you.
Same.
After everything, <br>
your world is nothing more than our travel destination.
It's convenient and there're countless delicious foods and drinks.
Because of that our highest orders made an agreement not to bring harmless to your land.
Someone against it will face their punishment.
Oh, yeah. <br>
Our land is your backyard now.
Hey!!! <br>
We pay for what I get.
To prevent further trouble. <br>
Our high mages created a Magic Dome around this island. 
It works as creating illusions in people's minds to make them familiar with us.
And make a fake mirage to the eyesight up high above.
Satellite?
Luckily, <br>
the energy emitting from the portal can support the Magic Dome.
Wait a minute!!!
Is this the main thing that causes my memory loss!?
Oh! It absolutely is!
Did you do something before coming back here?
Everything seems normal. <br>
I didn't get trucked by a bus... or something...
Oh!
What is it?
The first thing I encountered when I first came here was a hug from my beautiful Auntie.
Her boobs are so big. <br>
It is possible that its heavy mass curved spacetime.
I guess that is the case.
You're so stupid.
You don't seem disabled or anything. <br>
Mental and logical thinking seems fine. 
Oh, wait! It isn't.
Anyway, <br>
bear with it.
Hell yeah!!!
Imagine the miracles that people can dream of.
I'm the only that awake in this world, it will bring a lot of joy.
What are you guys talking about? The conversation sounds fun.
We talked about if there was any way I could get into her world.
Too bad, we can't go through that portal. 
Damn! <br>
So everybody on this island knew about this! 
the first person I asked was \C[3]Pixie\c[0].
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]: \C[3]+5\C[0] <br>
You've come at the right time!
I have something for you as I promised!
It's Powerup Fruit!!!
It... <br>
looks like an apple.
Are you sure?
It may look like an apple but it's a Magic Fruit.
Hurry up and eat it!
Okay. Okay!
It turned into a silky warm liquid that poured into my mouth when I bit into it.
I could feel it all over my body. <br>
It's just like soaking in a hot spring.
How is it? Do you feel anything?
I can feel a little stronger.
It's not my strength but my stamina.
It will make you more durable.
Too bad. <br>
It was greatly weakened when it got here.
I'm feeling much better now.
Thanks, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
I guess it will be really expensive in your world, right?
For other races, <br>
Yes!
But for fairies, like us. <br>
We have mother nature guide us there.
Isn't your mother a tree?
They are the same one.
Okay.
I almost forgot what I came here for.
Hey, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
I want to build a Bee Farm. <br>
I need your suggestions.
Honey!!?
Our favorite food!!! <br>
Hurry up and do it then!
Well, <br>
I already have a Bee House... "Scroll" <br>
but I don't know where to place it.
I don't want to make a farm here.
It's kinda dangerous.
I know a good place.
Really!?
You gotta help me with this!
What is it that makes you in such a hurry?
Hihihi!
I saw a bear!!
A brown one! <br>
It's so big like a walking mountain!
It's a bit unusual. <br>
But it's a forest anyway, anything could happen.
NO! 
It discovered our Bee Farm. <br>
I saw it eating our honey in the morning.
There was nothing left when I went back and checked.
WHAT!?
That's unacceptable!!
Hurry up! <br>
I will put it in its place!!!
She looks even more impatient than I am.
It's only there in the morning, <br>
it's useless if you go there by now.
I will take care of it tomorrow!
She looks like she can handle it.
Hi, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
Afternoon!
Can you get me some books from your world?
Hmm... That's a bit difficult...
You already know they forbid products from my world from circulating in yours...
Dang...
Aha! But don't worry. <br>
Since you're my good friend, I'll secretly get some for you.
*Gulps*
There won't be any trouble. Right!?!
I'll say I brought it with me just to read.
Brilliant!!!
Hehehe!
Unlike your world, books in my world are a bit more expensive...
H- How much!?
Not so sure... Let's say... \c[17]500\c[0]\i[172] for a book?
Yuck! Ok, I'll take it.
Deal!
Do you have a book like when I saved you after being drained by \C[3]Elphaba\C[0]?
But... It is about a teacher and her student.
I don't understand what book you are talking about.
(Damn it! How do I explain this...)
(How does \C[3]Pixie\c[0] know those dirty books...)
Let me ask my friend. Maybe she knows something about it.
You should come back tomorrow.
Oh! Thanks, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
Hihi!
How's it going, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!?
Here it is!
Did anything happen?
Nothing! <br>
She looked a little surprised and handed it to me.
Good! What's the price?
She said it was difficult to find because only nobles had it. <br>
So it's quite expensive.
Since it's an old book she's already read, <br>
it'll be a little cheaper. <br>
Only \c[17]3000\c[0]\i[172].
(\c[17]3000\c[0]\i[172] for a dirty book. God!)
Old book... <br>
This means \C[3]Pixie\c[0]'s friend read this before...
Never know girls could read this kind of stuff too... 
Okay, thanks, \C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
I don't have enough money, I'll buy it when I have rather enough.
Come back anytime!
You're welcome!
\c[14]TeacherXStudent Book\c[0]\i[233] \c[1]Acquired\c[0]
Hello! How can I help you?
I'm still here. If you want to buy or sell something, better do it before \c[20]5 PM\c[0].
Do you need anything else? 
I'm good
See you later then.
Follow
Hmm ... I really want to know where she is from. 
If I followed her... Maybe... 
Huh!?
Why are you following me? 
Ha-ha. This is also the direction I want to go, we're on the same way. 
Ah, Okay.
Man, her body is small but her butt is huge.  
Lift dress
Holy moly, there's nothing underneath her dress! 
I can clearly see everything. 
He-he. Reminds me of the old days lifting Anna's little doll's skirt. 
Damn!
What are you doing? 
There's a leaf on your skirt, I just wanted to take it out. 
Thanks, but that is my dress.
He-he. Sorry, sorry.
Lift Dress
End
Damn! She's so high, there's no way to keep up. 
I don't think this is the right choice. It's better to find another way. 
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]: \C[3]+3\C[0] <br>
Making snowman! Can't you see?
It's not even snow here. Are you dumb?
I'm not dumb. You just blind.
Doesn't make any sense. Well, enjoy talking with your imagining "friend".
Ha-ha! You dummy.
Hey!
I'm just talking with my friend.
WOOHOO! 
I can't believe I did that. 
Well... It's a bit small than usual... <br>
Maybe I didn't take care of it properly.
Anyway, let's take some of them for dinner's salad.
Should give them to \C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] while she is preparing dinner. 
Really sure she knows how to deal with them.
It took me a while <br>
but I've finally got my first Bee House "scroll".
A new problem is...
Where should I place it now?
If I place it somewhere here. <br>
The bees could sting \C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] or \C[2]Anna\C[0].
\C[3]Pixie\c[0]!
She is a Fairy. <br>
She really loves honey for sure!
I should talk to her when she's at the Cornfield.
\C[20]Ek\c[0] <br>
Why are you spacing out?
Hi, Grandpa!
How long have you been here?
I said don't call me like that.
I went for a walk and saw you standing there, <br>
thought you stroke or something.
The thing is...
I saw a video about the bee farm. <br>
I got hooked up and wanted to build a bee house...
But I don't know where to start.
Interesting!
As you can see I have a planting spot here for growing vegetables.
It's not a bad idea if I have a Bee Farm. <br>
I can collect honey and sell them for money.
I didn't have a good impression of him the first time we met.
But his actions recently have changed me a little bit.
I'm really worried for \C[5]Maleena\c[0], <br>
I can't live forever to take care of her...
Maybe, he's a good candidate... <br>
It's not bad to help him a little.
Ahem!
No exaggerating but I'm a solid crafter and builder.
You have seen my house, right?
Right.
I built it. 
The same goes for chicken coops and most other crafts.
Many things in this town have my fingerprints on them.
No way!
Come to my house tomorrow <br>
and I will show you how to deal with your problem.
Woohoo!!!
Alright! <br>
This place looks perfect!
It's time to summon the ALMIGHTY WORKBENCH!!!
Holy Moly!
I need to fix the \c[1]Broken Axe\c[0] and buy a \c[1]Hammer\c[0].
I should pay \C[2]Danesia\c[0] a visit in the \c[20]Afternoon\c[0].
Alright, alright, alright!
Let's check it out!!!
\c[14]A Location to Build On\c[0]
Nothing interesting.
Mornin'!
Uh... <br>
... and you are...?
\C[10]Korona\c[0] <br>
Oh, I'm \C[10]Korona\c[0], <br>
I deliver your newspapers.
We get the newspaper? <br>
This is *ahem* 'news' to me...
How original. <br>
Well if you didn't before, you do now!
(Something somewhere must've been updated.)
So... Do you walk all day for work? <br>
I don't see a bike or anything...
Yep! Keeps me in shape.
(Sounds terrible...)
Well, that sounds cool...
Well, I'm off! <br>
Nice meeting you!
Yeah, me too!
Ha-ha! You're so funny!
(Yeah... and you look weird...)
Hey! <br>
Beat you to the mailbox! Hehe!
Well... You do live right there...
Anyways... <br>
I've been wondering, what's up with the mask?
Well, as you know, <br>
I do a lot of traveling.
So just in case, <br>
I wear it so I don't get sick and I don't get other people sick.
If I'm sick, no mail to deliver, <br>
and if customers are sick, no one to deliver mail to.
Also, I just feel more comfortable wearing it.
Yeah, I can see what you mean.
Well... <br>
Do you think I could sneak a peek at what's underneath?
Oh noo noo, I'd rather not
Oh come on, just real quick! <br>
I just want to know who I'm making friends with.
Fine. <br>
But real quick tho, I have to finish my route!
Okay!
WTF! A second mask??
Okay okay, that's enough, I have to go!
No wait! I meant under all-
*Next Monday*
You scammed me last time!
Yeah! <br>
You were supposed to show me your face but you didn't!
Well, you only asked to see what's under the mask, <br>
and that's what's under.
Yea- well- uh-
(Damn! She got me...)
Well... you think maybe I can see your face this time?
I didn't want to last time, but I suppose it isn't so bad.
Yeah, sure!
There's still a mask!!!
Oh-oh! Just a habit. Hehe!
Do it right next time!
Okay, okay!
(Woah... she's cute...)
Okay there! <br>
I have to go now! 
See ya! Heehee!
Yeah! See ya!
(Hmm, maybe not so weird...)
Talk with her
Oh hey! Mornin'!
I got you newspaper.
Ask to show her face
Again!?
You know it's a pity that no one can see your pretty face...
Oh- alright!
See you next time!
Bye!
\C[10]Korona\c[0]: \C[3]+10\C[0] <br>
\C[10]Korona\c[0]: \v[167]
\C[10]Korona\c[0]: \C[3]+5\C[0] <br>
I'm coming!
Got a package for you, actually.
Special delivery instructions are as follows: <br>
"Only watch on \c[30]Halloween\c[0]"
And that concludes special delivery instructions.
Okay, see ya later!
W-wait! <br>
It's pouring out here, won't you stay for a bit and clean up?
Use our bathroom!
Hm, I guess I am ahead of schedule for today. Sure!
