Hello, sir. How can I help you?
Thank you. Please come again.

I’m going to pick out some clothes.
You can do something else while you wait.
Me <br>
It’s OK. I came here with you, so I might as well be here.
That’s the spirit.
Oh, that’s a cute dress. Give me a second, let me try it on.
How does this dress look?
Wow!
You look so nice and cute!
Thank you, \n[1]!
Aww, but it’s so expensive.
I can’t afford it.
I’ll look for other clothes.
I will buy it for you.
Really!?
Of course!!!
But I didn't bring enough money, I will buy it for you later.
Thank you so much, \n[1]!
Damn! These things are so expensive. Like three for four times normal.
But if it makes them happy, it's worth it.
I want to buy Auntie a dress too. For taking care of me.
That’s really generous of you.
How about we surprise her at dinner?
That's a great idea!
I bet mom will be amazed and love it!
