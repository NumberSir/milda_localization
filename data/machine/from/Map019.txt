She's down there!!!
There's no place to hide up there!!!
Wrong way!!!
The second floor now. \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0]'s office should be in the right corridor. 
\C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0] <br>
WHO IS THERE!?
Shit!!! It's \C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0].
I need to find a place to hide!!!
There's a \c[1]Locker\c[0] in my \c[1]Classroom\c[0]
Alright, let's fix it!
Hmm... There is still squeaky sound coming from it when stepped on. 
Well, I'm not professional anyway. 
\C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0] <br>
It's you, \n[1]. Is everything ok?
Hi, \C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0].
I have fixed it but there is still noise coming from it when stepped on. 
It's acttually really good. Don't concern about it too much.
I will help you return the tools. 
Thank you very much, \C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0].
The floor wasn't completely fixed but I can avoid stepping on it. 
He-he. But if I did it on purpose, it would be loud noise at night.
