Me <br>
Is this the way to \C[3]Elphaba\C[0]'s house?
??? <br>
\n[1]...
\n[1]!
Who is there!?
Listen! 
We don't have much time.
I am the servant of Master \C[3]Elphaba\C[0]. <br>
You are currently in the realm of an Evil Spirit!
I tried to communicate with you but somehow got disturbed by the evil energy.
There's no way to escape from here by yourself nor I can do anything with it.
The creature is utterly chaotic. <br>
They exist to destroy and kill.
Their favorite is consuming living things' fear.
What!? <br>
Am I gonna die!!?
The worst case is yes.
Please save me!!!
Don't let fear settle in your heart.
Take this stone. <br>
It can be used as an Explosion Spell.
Will it kill the monster?
I'm afraid it won't. <br>
Only use it at the critical moment.
I have used all my energy to communicate and transfer the spell stone to you.
I can sense its stinky rotten energy.
It won't kill you immediately. <br>
Those things like making fun of its victim while enjoying their fear.
I will look for Master \C[3]Elphaba\C[0]. <br>
Try to buy some time.
Hey!
Hey!!!
She's gone!
Dammit!
Why am I getting into this!?
I'm too careless! <br>
Magic energy has come to this land.
Weird shit could easily happen.
Worrying is useless.
I should stay calm. <br>
\C[3]Elphaba\C[0] will be here soon...
*Phew*
I've finally found someone around here!
Do you know how to get out of this fucking place?
Is he the monster!?
I can feel a weird feeling from him. <br>
It's probably it...
*Hah*
I'm also stuck. <br>
Been walking for like hours and still in the same place.
How about accompanying? <br>
Two heads are better than one.
This place is too quiet. <br>
It's giving me a weird shit...
Ok, that sounds like a good plan.
At least I'm safe for now. 
Not sure what "it" is up to but I should be on high alert...
Damn... <br>
I can't see any emotions on its face...
And its skin... <br>
just like a walking corpse...
It's giving my back shivers even though it's wetting sweet right now...
*Gulps*
What's wrong, dude? <br>
Is there something on my face?
Nah, I just looked around. <br>
Looking for something "different".
It feels like a loop in here.
You're right! <br>
Keep looking! I hope we can get out of here soon.
Huh!?
I should keep moving!
How long have I been running?
Hah hah
I'm so tired that I can't feel my legs anymore...
I should keep moving...
Why did you run?
I-I was just... looking for you...
Why didn't you save me?
I thought you were dead...
Dead... 
That's right...
I was already dead!!!
Maybe I can convince him.
Then you will go with me!
DIE!!!
AHHhh!
A magic shield can save you once but it can't save you forever.
What just that!?
I could feel it from the Necklace that \C[3]Elphaba\C[0] gave me!
It's strange I don't feel any fear released from you from the beginning till now.
I'm bored.
I lost my interest in playing games with you.
Your meat and blood will be your most valuable.
Mwahaha!!!
Dammit! He knew it! <br>
I can't hold it anymore...
There's only one last thing...
Before I will be consumed by you...
Can you come closer? <br>
I want to take a closer look at you.
I will grant your last wish.
Take a closer look at my being and your shaking soul will be...
The most nutritious feast!
Ahhh~ <br>
Much better.
Hmm~
Delicious!
I can feel so much fear releasing from you.
I should have shown my true self from the beginning.
Hah hah...
As I expected...
You're the ugliest walking thing that ever existed!
EAT SHIT!!!
GAHHHH!!!
I'M BURNING!!!
What did you do!?
It's so HURT!!!
For making me suffer!
I will eat everything of you as slowly as I can!
You will be suffered from eternal pain still your... <br>
LAST BREATH!!!
You... know what.
The biggest mistake of villains is talking too much.
Maybe, talk less next time and you could get my ass.
What!?
\C[3]Elphaba\C[0] <br>
He's right!
GARRRHHHH!!!
