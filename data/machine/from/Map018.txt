Me <br>
I managed to get in here. Easy enough!
Now let go to the 2nd floor. 
The floor is made of wood. Hope it doesn't make any loud noise.

I'll go get the tools.
Luckily, all the necessary items are available. 
Oops...
Are you okay?
He-he, I'm fine. But don't tell anyone, okay?
*Phew*
Here.
Thank you very much, \C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0]. I think these are enough for what I need. 
In that case, if you need anything come and ask me. 
See you later, \C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0].
Okay, I should go and fix it now.
