You should do some pushup dude! You look like a peipar to me.
Do you know anything yet? 
There was a group of people reported as missing and miraculously appeared outside the forest without any problem.
Are they okay?
They are fine as always. Just exhausted and passed out.
Fine as always?
What are you guys talking about? Looks like this happened not just only once.
Oh, new face!
I have never seen you before.
I am a new transfer student. I just moved here not too long ago. My name is \n[1].
We're talking about a group of people who went missing in the woods. 
This is so common and they named it the Lost Woods.
There were some people who went on it as an adventure and the common point was that they went missing and passed out outside the forest the next day.
It's so scary. Is it a haunted forest?
Ha-ha. Don't worry?
They were all fine and only lost some memory before entering the forest.
I guess it was an unpleasant feeling. Haha. 
Just imagine you want to do something and suddenly you forget it. After a while, you think about it but have no way of remembering what you wanted to do.
Yeah, It happened to me a number of times when I walked through a doorway. Some say it's the doorway effect.
It made me really curious. I should go there and see it for a bit.
It looks harmless anyway, the worst part is just getting too tired and losing a bit of memory.
Do you know where it is? I mean the Lost Woods.
Do you also want to go there and check it out?
Yeah, it looks fun. Don't you think?
Ha-ha. I bet he will last one minute.
Come on, dude! At least one minute and one second.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha!
Hey! You still haven't answered my question and I think you are leading this conversation in a different direction.
Ha-ha, sorry! Do you know where is the forest?
If I remember correctly, there is a forest to the left side of \C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0]'s house.
I think I know it. There is a forest to the left of where I live.
Yes, that is the one. There is only one forest in this town.
When you have arrived in the forest, just keep going to the left and you will get to the Lost Woods Passageway.
When you have arrived there, the Lost Woods is up ahead.
Oh, thanks!
Just let us know if you can last longer than a minute a second.
I know it's not dangerous but it's better to go there in the morning.
\C[25]Ms. Megan\C[0] <br>
Ha-ha. What are two love birds doing here?
Retry
Stop right there!!!

Hi, \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0].
\C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0] <br>
Good moring, \n[1]. 
Are you keeping up with the curriculum? Also don't worry, if you don't understand something I can tutor you after the morning class. 
Ha-ha. I'm fine. 
But I really hope you can tutor me after class. 
That's great!
Anyway, I forgot to tell you something. After class, you need to visit the principal to sign your attendance for the first time. 
Okay! Thanks, \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0].
...
But where is he? I'm still new in here.
You can find her office in the left corridor of the third floor.
Okay, I have to go. See you in class. 
See you later,  \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0].
The Principal... I wonder what he looks like.
He-he. Must be a man with a beer belly. 
I should get there after \c[20]3 PM\c[0].
