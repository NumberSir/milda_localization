Me <br>
It's late I should go to sleep.
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] <br>
Alright, alright! You win.
You can leave now.
He-he. Victory is mine!
<c:0,120,0>How dare you!
<c:0,120,0>Get over here!
Come here!
Such a beautiful slice of meat,  I can't wait to know how it tastes.
I'm screwed! I don't know what she would do to me. Better get out before it's too late.
What is this? She's too strong!
Ugh... Her tough is a bit cold.
This slippery and... cold... It's so good...
Looks like the dish is ready. Let's see how it tastes. 
Ahh... Her mouth is so cold.
My dick is so numb... I can feel my strength is leaking out.
This is bad! I should struggle and get out of here before I couldn't hold it anymore.
Press \c[1]Left Arrow\c[0] or \c[1]Right Arrow\c[0] to struggle.
It's so good, I'm cumming!!!
I'm too tired...
Delicious.
I will keep you as my food supply.
You will be staying here forever.

Man, such a weird dream...

It's already midnight. I should probably go to bed.
Do you think I can time travel?
\^
500\i[172] and a piece of candy!
No need to guess who they are!
How did they sneak into my room?
WOO!!! It's \c[2]Christmas\c[0]!
WOO!!! It's \c[30]Halloween\c[0]!
What should I wear today? 
A mail?
\c[13]Leto's Shop\c[0] <br>
Our treat for this \c[30]Halloween\c[0] is \c[10]25% OFF\c[0], ONLY UNTIL MIDNIGHT!
I've saved their number anyway. Not hurt to make a call.
I wonder what they sell.
That dream again. 
It always stops at the scene where \C[20]Mae\C[0] takes me to watch her parents have sex and then she plays with my dick.
I feel like I forgot a lot of things since I left here to go to the city with my mom.
Man, \C[25]Aunt Douie\C[0] is so hot. I would love to see them live action again.
They do it very loudly and can hear it from several miles away.
Fortunately, their house is far from residential areas.
I wonder if they will do that tonight.
They always do it every night, I and \C[20]Mae\C[0] sometimes watch them do it back then.
I should go there at \c[20]10 PM\c[0].
Gulps...
Such a wild memory...
I don't think I've fuck \C[20]Mae\C[0] back then.
It was amazing.
We did a few times after that.
Her dad/\C[2]Mr. Carter\C[0] didn't let us play together anymore because we were too close.
If he knew what we did. Maybe it wasn't that simple.
Shit! A wet dream.
Damn! I must clean it quickly.
\C[20]Mae\C[0]: \C[3]+5\C[0] <br>
\C[20]Mae\C[0]: \v[37]
Damn... <br>
Now I know why \C[20]Mae\C[0] always makes fun of me.
Mom is probably in the city right now. <br>
She left and I didn't even notice.

Urghhh...
Maaaannn... How am I still so tired!? <br>
I feel like I just ran ten laps around the school.
I've heard that people sometimes move around while dreaming...
What the heck!? <br>
What are these stains!!?
Did I... no...
Something weird is going on... <br>
Especially since I don't think I've had any wet dreams for 7 days now
I'm gonna keep watch tonight, and figure this out.
I know! <br>
I'll buy a \c[14]Coffee\c[0]\i[238] to make sure I stay awake!
I need to go to the \c[1]Convenience Store\c[0]!
