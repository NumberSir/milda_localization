Me <br>
I think I've come to the right place.
There's a warning sign here. I think ahead is the entrance to the Lost Woods.
Gulp
For some reason, it's a bit creepy here.
Alright, let's go!
Woo-hoo! Finally got out of that weird place. 
I don't lose any memories either.
I'm one in a million, baby.
It also doesn't appear to be dangerous. I think the necklace that \C[3]Elphaba\C[0] gave me did it.
I don't know why I think like that but it's better to keep it very carefully.
Huh!?
What is that!?
Anyway...
