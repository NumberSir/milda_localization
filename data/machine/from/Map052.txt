Me <br>
I should talk \C[3]Elphaba\C[0] if I want to leave.
\C[3]Elphaba\C[0] <br>
I have something for you. 
What is this?
You will feel better after drinking it.
Sweet!
I'm thirsty as hell.
Wow! I feel like I'm full of energy. The feeling of being tired from walking around in the forest seemed to have disappeared.
That is its effect and it has a side effect.
Side effect. What is its side effect?
What is happening? Why do I feel so tired?
That is its side effect.
Wait, what!? So why did you let me drink it?
For fun.
What!? You're so evil.
That's what they always say.
Ha-ha.
What are all those things? Looks like you want to do something.
What do they call? Something like ache...
Alchemist.
Ha-ha! That's right. Alchemist!!!
You look more like a witch to me.
I have finished arranging everything. I'll take you out now.
??? <br>
Welcome to my house! Make yourself at home.
Holy cow! It feels like going back a hundred years.
What kind of decoration is this?
Hey... erm...
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. 
\C[3]Elphaba\C[0] is my name.
My name is \n[1].
What is this door?
Stay away from it.
Hmm...
Now, I'm more curious.
This is no joke. 
If you've seen anything in there, it's a pity...
That I have to eliminate you.
Ha-ha. Just kidding.
Phew. You scared me there for a moment.
Seriously, don't go in there.
Gulp.
Okay, I have to sort things out. If there's any problem just ask me.
Okay.
What is this place, I feel like walking into a fairy tale book.
Is that a cauldron? Man, I feel like I'm in a witch house right now.
This place gives me a warm feeling. I think it's just my imagination.
I'm really curious what's behind this door but it's better not to touch it.
