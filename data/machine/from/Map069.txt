\C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0] <br>
How do you feel, \n[1]! Did you have fun?
Me <br>
I wish every day is outdoor class!
Ha-ha!
End Class
No
Alright, everyone! That's enough for today.
Boy <br>
Uurgh! Come on...
Just a little bit more, \C[14]Ms. Emmi\C[0]
Don't worry, we have outdoor class every week!
The whole class <br>
YEAH!!
Now, let's go back!
It was so fun! <br>
I'm looking forward to next week's outdoor class!
\C[6]Ms. Betty\C[0] <br>
I'm busy, talk to someone else.
Girl <br>
Hey! Wanna go and pick some flowers?
\C[27]Mabel\C[0] <br>
I better stay here...
\C[21]Brad\C[0] <br>
You wanna eat my fist or maybe your ass wants to taste my foot!
Stay away from me!
Alright class, we're here!
Find a spot to set your bags down.
Oh, you can set the materials down here, \n[1].
Say no more...
Thanks for the help \n[1]. <br>
I'll take it from here.
Go and set your stuff down so I can explain our activity.
(Can't... feel... my arms...)
That's all for today's lesson!
Stay away from mushrooms you don't know or that are brightly colored.
If you are bleeding or bitten by a snake, <br>
come here immediately.
Don't get any funny ideas.
There's a campfire over there, <br>
you can grill mushrooms or roast marshmallows.
Think of it as a picnic. <br>
We will return in the afternoon.
\c[14]Work in process! <br>
There is nothing you can do here yet. <br>
Talk with Emmi to end the outdoor class.
