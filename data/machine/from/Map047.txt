Thank you. Please come again.
Me <br>
Hmm...
I couldn't find it anywhere. Better ask the shopkeeper.
Hello, I want to buy something like this.
Hi, please wait a moment.
We're sorry! It seems that we have sold out of this product.
Do you want to buy similar products?
Doesn't seem okay. I buy this for a friend.
Tell me how they are. I can advise you.
She is my girlfriend.
Well. She is a girl and probably count as my friend. 
So... I guess nothing wrong with it.
In that case, you can try this.
This will bring pleasure to both her and yourself.
What the hell?
It is sunscreen anyway. It would be fine...
I guess...
It looks so familiar...
Oh! Look like I already bought it.
It will be 2000\i[172].
Buy
No
Do you need anything else?
I only take this. Thanks!
I will look for another sunscreen oil.
Oh man, 2000\i[172]! I don't have enough money. Better get it next time.
I will find another sunscreen oil.
Thank you very much! Please tell me if you need anything else.
