\C[2]Anna\C[0] <br>
I have finished my homework. 
It's late, I should go to bed. 
\n[1]'s a strange magazine.
Whoa!
Me <br>
What are you doing, \C[2]Anna\C[0]?
...
It's you, \n[1].
I'm doing my homework.
...but it's really hard.
Lemme see it.
Are you sure? I only saw you're running around without any study. I don't think you can handle it.
I'm smarter than you. 
I don't think so.
Here you go.
Hmm...
...I also don't know how to do it.
\C[2]Anna\C[0] would laugh to death if I said so...
I have an idea!
Ahem!
Did you know how to solve those questions?
Yes, I know how to solve those questions but I won't write them down...
Ha-ha. I already knew you can't handle it.
Wait! Let me finish my line.
Give a man a fish, and he will eat it right away. Teach him to catch a fish, he can catch another fish.
Wait, I don't remember them saying something like that.
Don't pay attention to the little things.
Today, I will teach you how to catch fish.
Take a look at the homework notebook. Do you see anything strange?
No, I don't. 
Look at all the crap you've drawn.
Eh! They're cute.
It shows that you were not paying attention at all. You didn't focus on doing your homework.
You-You right!
Of course.
I will teach you to pay more focus on your homework by training your body sensations.
Whoa! I don't know every word you say but it's very professional.
So, what will we do now?
Take off your clothes and sit on the chair.
Okay.
Wait, what!?
I will teach you how to fish, of course!
Ah, okay.
Gulp
Ahh! This homework is too hard.
I should help her out sometime.
What is it?
Looks like your training doesn't increase my focus anymore.
In that case, let's move to another level.
Today's exercise will increase the intensity and more importantly...
What, what is it!?
He-he. Look like you knew how to fish...
I'll give you a fishing rod this time.
Let's play a betting game.
No no no. Mom says betting is bad.
Ha-ha. Don't worry. It's bad because they use the money to bet.
Tell me what do you want to eat right now?
Hmm... I want a dessert right now... Pudding...
That's right! I want to eat pudding, my favorite.
Good. Let's make a condition.
If my training doesn't work you win but if my training works you lose.
Oh, okay.
If you win I'll buy you a pudding.
Yay!
If you lose...
Uh-huh.
If you lose you have to suck my pee pee.
Okay, okay. Hurry up! Your training won't work anyway, I want a pudding now.
What!? I thought she would refuse or something... 
Anyway...
Forgot to ask, where to buy pudding?
You can buy it at the convenience store on your way to school.
Cool. 
Cheating is not allowed.
Hey! I'm not that kind of person.
I should buy a \c[14]Pudding\i[286]\c[0] first before playing with her...
I mean help her with her homework.
I can buy it at the convenience store on my way to school.
What are you doing?
Help her
Not now
Let's me help you with your homework!
Okay!
Look at this!
Pudding!
I don't have any \c[14]Pudding\i[286]\c[0].
I need buy it at the convenience store on my way to school first.
(I should help her out sometime.)
I can't even move my pen. It's so hard.
Too bad
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \C[3]+2\C[0] <br>
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \v[23]
Pudding, Pudding! Give me my pudding.
Okay, okay! Here you go.
Care to suck my dick?
No way, I win.
Okay, okay!
Wow! I'm so focused that I don't even know.
He-he.
\C[2]Anna\C[0]: \C[3]+5\C[0] <br>
It's your time to suck my big rod.
Wait! This is what you mean when you say give me a fishing rod.
Well... kind of.
Anyway. You have already lost, you should pay your bet. I will give you a gift after this.
Okay, okay.
Whoa! 
It's so big. How did you get it to fit in your pants?
He-he...
\C[20]Auntie Daisy\C[0] <br>
\C[2]Anna\C[0]. What is that sound?
Holy cow, it's Aunty!!!
Oh, \n[1]. What are you doing here? 
Hey, mom! I'm going to suc...
Ha-ha!
I'm here to help her with her homework.
She dropped her pen and was looking for a long time. She's suck on it.
Ha-ha. That's really nice of you for taking good care of your cousin.
Okay, I'm leaving now. Don't stay up too late.
Phew
It freaked me out.
I don't know what she would do if she found her daughter naked with her face in front of my crotch.
Okay, you can do it now.
It's so big, I don't know if my mouth is big enough to put it on.
Aaaa...
Mmm...
Look like you can do it without any problem.
Holy cow, her mouth is so warm and slippery.
It's so soft, I can feel my dick surrounded by her mouth muscle and her soft tongue.
Next
You're so good at this. I guess the cow udder sucking skill is doing a good job.
Faster
She is sucking so hard. I feel like my dickhead is blowing up. 
It feels so good. I feel like she wants to suck the milk out of my balls.
Cum
I can't hold it anymore. It's coming!
It was so good, \C[2]Anna\C[0].
You let it out a lot. I feel like my tummy is blown up.
A cup of milk before bed is very good for you.
Feel like a cup of cheese. I feel it's still sticking on my throat.
End
Here you go. 
Wow! Pudding!
Hey! Don't kiss me after sucking my dick.
He-he... Say hello to my little brother.
Oh, \n[1]. You're here too.
Oh! Hi Aunty!
Where is \C[2]Anna\C[0]?
She- she is in the toilet. He has a funny stomach.
!!?
\C[2]Anna\C[0], you little naughty!
Is there something wrong, \n[1]?
Hey, \n[1]! 
I-I'm fine, Aunty.
Holy crap! She's sucking me so hard.
It feels so good but not in this situation...
\C[2]Anna\C[0], Stop!
What are you doing? You pinhead.
Are you okay? You don't look so well.
Aren't you looking for \C[2]Anna\C[0]? I'll call her when she comes back.
Damn, \C[2]Anna\C[0]! She's speeding up.
It's so good. I don't think I can hold it anymore.
I'm fine, I came here because I heard some strange noises.
If everything is fine, then I'll go now.
Okay, see you later Aunty.
I can't hold it anymore.
It's coming!
It was so good...
I feel like peeing my heart out!!!
What is it? I came out way much more than usual.
If I hadn't swallowed it quickly it might have gotten up my nose.
You scared me to death.
Your mouth is so warm and slippery.
You're sucking me so hard. I feel like my dickhead is blowing up. 
It feels so good. It feels like you want to drink the milk directly from my balls.
You let it out a lot. My belly is like a balloon now.
More like a cup of cheese. It's so sticky.
It's already this late. Good night.
I'm so tired. Better go to sleep soon.
Good night.
Hey \n[1], do you need something? Otherwise, I'll continue on reading.
Don't mind me, I'm just passing by.
Okay, you can stay as long as you want, but don't stare at my butt okay?
It's Laundry Day. Maybe I could ask Auntie to collect the dirty clothes.
Heh...Heh... It's Anna's pantie...
What am I gonna do with that?
Pick them all up and put those in the bathroom's basket, obviously.
