\C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0] <br>
Squeaky, squeaky. Clean, clean...
Me <br>
She's so adorable.
Damn! This restroom is huge. Is this really for only one person use?
There're urinals... Why there is something like this in a woman's restroom?
I wonder what she would look like when standing pee? 
Ha-ha. That's would be fun.

Kinda make sense tho. The school president can be a woman or man.
What are you doing here? You should leave now. It would be very bad if the security guards catch you here. 
I got carry away. She must be \C[4]Ms. Susan\C[0] that \C[30]Mrs. Adeera\C[0] was talking about.
Hi, I'm \n[1]. \C[30]Mrs. Adeera\C[0] force me to fix....
Ahem...
I mean, I saw a broken plank in the 2nd floor. I want to fix it and \C[30]Mrs. Adeera\C[0] tell me to meet you here for needed tools.
Not a bad idea to take all of the credits to me. I did it anyway.
Whoa! You such a good boy.
\C[30]Mrs. Adeera\C[0] already called the repair team but they didn't come for a long time. 
Follow me. The tools are in the 1st floor below. 
If I remember correctly, there are all the necessary tools to repair that broken place.
